    "### Part 1 - Election Prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you are looking at an election in a fictional province. There are 7 total elctoral districts, and the winner in each district is determined by a first-past-the-post system (what we have in Canada - the most votes wins, regardless of share). There are two parties - the Purples and the Yellows. Whoever controls the most seats will be the ruling party - so in our 2 party scenario, the party who wins 4 or more of the districts will govern. There is an election every year, they love voting. \n",
    "\n",
    "Recent polling indicating the expected vote share in each district is shown in the \"dist_polls\" table below. These values are a composite of several polls that the experts have combined and weighted. The \"Purple\" values show the expected vote share of the Purple party, along with the variance of that expectation and the number of polls that were combined to get that result.  \n",
    "\n",
    "As well, research has shown that the vote distribution is impacted by voter turnout. In general, the more people vote, the more the vote split shifts towards the Yellow party. We have data on past elections and the results, we expect that the turnout will be in line with the past elections - or more specifically, we have no reason to expect it to differ. This impact is measured in the table in code below - that table shows the voter turnout, in a percentage, as well as the change in the Yellow party's vote share (also in percentage) as compared to the polling averages. For example, if one row showed \"52\" and \".8\", that would mean that voter turnout was 52%, and the Yellow party got .8% higher of a vote share than the polling showed. \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>What is the probability that the Purple Party controls the government after the election?</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Note:</b> the errors and confidence intervals are not totally trivial. As part of the written answer, offer an evaluation of your confidence in the prediction, and why you think that. This is not a question with one specific error, your estimation will have some expected errors, somewhere. You may not have the tools to calculate it all the way through, that's fine. "
